# 🍽️ Date Night Dinner — Cute Random Restaurant Picker  
A personalized, aesthetic JavaFX app created to help couples decide what to eat (because picking dinner is HARD 😭💕).

This project was originally made as a fun, animated, interactive app for my girlfriend and me — and has grown into a fully-featured JavaFX experience with cute visuals, animated hearts, dinner tickets, and a random restaurant algorithm.
